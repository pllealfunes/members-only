# Members Only
This project was created using Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas, Passport.js, Bycrypt.js, and Moment. The purpose of the project is to practice applying authentication to a node app. The project idea comes from the Odin Project Node.js Curriculum.

Anyone who comes to the site should be able to see a list of all messages, with the authorâ€™s name hidden. Users are able to sign-up and create messages, but ONLY users that are members are able to see the author of each message. Finally, a user who is an Admin is able to see everything and also has the ability to delete messages.
